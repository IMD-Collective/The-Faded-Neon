tur_rampant_factionalism_desc:0 "The Turkish Armed Forces, the protectors of the Republic of Turkey, were supposed to be completely loyal to the CDPTI. Yet, just like the old days of the 1960s, it became filled with cliques and personal rivalries. While fear of punishment keeps those cliques away from attempting a coup the Colonel is getting older and once he dies the cliques will make their moves, just like vultures do to corpses."

tur_balancing_the_powers_desc:0 "The Partnership for Liberty, led by France and the Cominform, led by the German Democratic Republic are the two big powers of Europe. Both powers want to pull us to bind us to their sphere of influence and they're ready to do everything for even the slightest tip in the scales. With the Turkish economy revitalized thanks to the two powers' rivalry, it seems beneficial to keep both sides vying for Turkeys alliance."

tur_regional_problems:0 "Regional Problems"
tur_regional_problems_desc:0 "Our great country prevailed against the foreign powers sixty years ago but now is now barely able to protect its border against both cultists in the West and Kurds in the East. In Bulgaria cultists spread their poison all around Thrace, killing our people. In the Eastern Provinces, the Kurds begin to disturb this peace, with their demands for freedom from Turkish rule. Those two problems must be dealt with, otherwise our governments already low popularity will shrink further."
