benevolent_manager:0 "The Benevolent Manager"
benevolent_manager_desc:0 "In Chelyabinsk, we are ruled by a benevolent man who only goes by the name of 'The Manager'. He has provided the people under his iron fist: fresh food, clean water and a fuctional society despite the collapse of the USSR. However if you fail to meet your quotas you shall face an unknown fate and never be seen again..."

soviet_garrison:0 "Soviet Garrison"
soviet_garrison_desc:0 "Just before the wave, the Soviet goverment in Moscow dispatched it's troops in important sections of the nation, this included Chelyabinsk due to its industrial capabilities. However after the collapse and no one to report to the garrison soon was taking orders from the manager after proving himself as an efficient leader economically and politically. Why many among the garrison disagree with The Manager's harsh labour polices they are afraid of couping him as they may lose their manufacturing capabilities of guns and other war materials.\n§R If the garrison finds a new leader(s) to replace The Manager they will most likely swap sides."
