  TRA_Mihai_Racovitza_desc:0 "While little is known about his upbringing, it is known that his father was a veteran of the First World War. Young Racovitza followed in his fathers footsteps, joining the army when he came of age, before fighting on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. He served within the Romanian military until the Coup under King Michael in 1944. He retired after that, being given full military pension and a farm provided by the government for his service. When the Communists took power and overthrew the monarch however, like many others who shared his fate, his military pension was cut off and he was put under strict watch due to having fought on the side of the fascist menace during the Second World War. Racovitza, along with many other veterans, protested these actions, but were ignored, or sent to labour camps to be worked to death. Following the rioting in 1982, and the start of the civil war, Racovitza was quick to gain power due to his background, and military tactics expertise. Racovitza's ideas were popularized as he was an outspoken anti-authoritarian, and denounced the government in Bucharest. While the military elements in Transylvania attempted to hold power, they caved under popular opinion and gave in, allowing for open elections which Racovitza and his newly formed conservative faction won in a landslide vote. However, the man is in his early 60's now, having suffered from the war and having a violent and deadly virus to fear, it is unknown if he will survive long enough to see the country he loves reunited under one banner, a democratic and free banner."

  TRA_Insurgent_Terror:0 "The Mircea Insurgency"
  TRA_Insurgent_Terror_desc:0 "Despite the Kishinev Accords being signed, and a ceasefire being declared, the Southern Government has clearly failed to ratify the treaty. General Dinu Mircea of the People's Army continually raids settlements within Transylvania, making use of unknown mountain passes to enter Transylvanian territory without issue. This terror has plagued the innocents of Transylvania since the raids began, spreading terror throughout the villages and cities. People live in fear and are fleeing the nation, causing a crisis within the government. The only areas safe from these inhumane raids are the areas past the Apuseni. Unless something is done, we may soon lose our grasp on the Southern Region of Transylvania.\n\n §RUnless something is done, our grasp on the regions of§! §YBanat§!§R,§! §YVulcan§!§R,§! §YFagaras§!§R,§! §YAlba§!§R, and§! §YSighisoara§!§R will be at risk of revolt.§!"
  TRA_Aftermath_of_Stalinization:0 "The Aftermath of Collectivization"
  TRA_Aftermath_of_Stalinization_desc:0 "When the Communists gained control of the nation in the 50's, a mass wave of Collectivization began throughout the country, which turned all land over to the government, and saw much of it being turned into grounds for the ever expanding needs of an industrializing nation. Transylvania was once a place of beautiful, peaceful cities, fertile valleys, and was far from the difficulties of industrilized society. Now however, the fields have long turned to brown, the cities choked out with the toxic fumes of unsafe factories built to produce goods to send South to the people in the cities. This unchecked industrialization, which was forced upon the region by the government, has left it's scars deep in the once fertile soil of the region. The unsafe conditions also led to an exodus of people from the farms, who moved into the cities in search of better healthcare, education, or an escape from the now ugly countryside. These effects have left entire towns deserved, and these towns serve as a bleak reminder to the horrific past of Stalinization."
  TRA_Memories_of_Vulcan:0 "Memories of the Vulcan Pass"
  TRA_Memories_of_Vulcan_desc:0 "During the early stages of the Civil War, Transylvanian units moved to take the vital Vulcan Pass in Oltenia, near Hunedoara and Targu Jiu. The operation on paper was a success, however, to those who fought, it was anything but. The Vulcan Pass was the sight of an intense battle, one of unknown horror. Countless hundreds and thousands on both sides died for the pass, bodies grew greater in number by the day, and the fighting never stopped. When the rains set in during the summer season, the smell of rot and decaying bodies filled the valley, and then the next summer, nature reclaimed those who had died and used them as fertilizer, flowers blossoming like they never had before, grown by the suffering of men and women alike who gave their lives for a cause that many don't understand anymore. This has had a profound effect on the Transylvanian Military, many senior officers having served in the battle still suffer night terrors from the sound of thunderous artillery and the screams of death that filled the air. Those who returned home were often missing limbs, the others who returned home came by the truckload in coffins, the flag of Romania drapped over them as they departed to the next life. No one in Transylvania, or Southern Romania wants to ever have to experience something has awful as the Battle of the Vulcan Pass again, and the army has ever since been demoralized by the tails of horror that have come from the disastrous confrontation."
  TRA_Second_Liberation_War:0 "The Second Liberation War"
  TRA_Second_Liberation_War_desc:0 "Romania is divided, the three main factions all claiming to be the legitimate government. While Transylvania and Moldova currently share an alliance in order to tackle the greater threat to the South, the days of this alliance are fading quickly as issues over religion and minority rights continue to plague the politics which once allowed the two governments to work side by side. Many people are also supportive of the Orthodox Church, which has proclaimed a government out of Jassy. Many are sympathetic to the Orthodox ways, and shy away from fighting their brothers. A ceasefire has currently held between all three nations, talks of peace and reunification are getting no where, and many believe that soon, a bloody, violent conflict will break out in Romanian soil once more, and when it does, only one may enter the cage and survive."

#TRA_Hungarian_Minority:0 "The Szkelyland Minority"
#TRA_Hungarian_Minority_desc:0 "In the event of war, the states of §RSzeklerland§! and §RBihor§! will revolt. Revolts may also happen in §RCrisana§!, and §RBistritza§!.\n\n Transylvania has a large Hungarian minority, notably along the border, and deep within the region of Sekelyland in Eastern Transylvania. During Communist rule, the Hungarian minority was treated with special rights such as exemption from harsh taxation and were largely left uncollectivised in order to avoid backlash from the Hungarian Soviet Republic. When the government out of Cluj-Napoca took control of the region, these special rights stopped nearly instantly, leading to rioting and anger. The current government has no interest in regranting these special rights, and there are some regions in the Republic which remain in a state of near constant martial law, making for low support from the general public, and straining relations with the new Hungarian government in Budapest."
#TRA_Democratic_Foothold:0 "The Dream of Freedom"
#TRA_Democratic_Foothold_desc:0 "Since World War II ended in defeat, the Romanian people have suffered under the harsh terms of the Warsaw Pact, being a very isolationist, and very Stalinistic nation. Purges were not uncommon, and political freedoms were a near nonexistant practice. The actual opinions of the people fell on deaf ears of the government profiting off of the suffering of the masses. Now, with the outbreak of the civil war, an unexpected turn of events has unfolded within Transylvania. Instead of reverting back to the authoritarian ways of old, a new democracy has blossomed at the hands of Transylvanian politician Mihai Racovitza. Romanians and other ethnicities alike have begun to flood into the country, hoping to escape the authoritarian and violent ways of the past, a shining beacon of hope now emerges from the Balkans, whether or not that light will last however, has yet to be seen."
