POL_torn_country:0 "A Country Torn in Two"
POL_torn_country_desc:0 "With the 1973 Agreement still in place, trade unions and other political organisations are free to roam the urban centres of Poland. With nothing to stop them, the west and east divide has, ironically, arose once again, this time within the country. The opposition is secretly arming itself to prepare for the worst, at least according to the findings of the Internal Security Ministry."
POL_red_world_stashes:0 "Stashes of the Old Red World"
POL_red_world_stashes_desc:0 "With Soviet equipment left behind after the Soviet troops from the Northern Group of Forces hastily evacuated from Poland, the Polish army has gathered a substantial supply of high-end military equipment."
POL_chairman_rumours:0 "Rumours of the Previous Chairman"
POL_chairman_rumours_desc:0 "While the previous chairman has escaped in 1981, his countless supporters did not, still scheming behind our backs to arrange for his return. Their actions need to be curbed as soon as possible, as his return, bound to gather huge public support, would be a devastating blow to our current regime.\n\n§RSome rumours say his supporters already infiltrated our party ranks...§!"
POL_plague_behind:0 "What the Plague Left Behind"
POL_plague_behind_desc:0 "After three consecutive waves of the disease swept across Poland, many densely populated urban and industrial areas were left much more empty, sparking concerns about lack of workforce to operate the factories and keep the cities alive. While the previous ruling cabinet supported immigration into the devastated regions, our path to fully rebuilding our capabilities is still long and full of obstacles which we will have to overcome."
