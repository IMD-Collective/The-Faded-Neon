HUN_Spirit_of_the_Molotov:0 "Spirit of the Molotov"
HUN_Spirit_of_the_Molotov_desc:0 "The Generation of Hope, born in the 1950s, may not have experienced the ‘56 Revolution, but was definitely molded by the images of it. The tanks that rolled through Budapest and the molotovs that spread destruction would be cemented in their minds, not as a concept of fear and authoritarian might, but of hope. Revolutionary hope. The spirit of the Molotov continues to grip the young Republic, as the youth of Hungary embraces the future through revolutionary optimism that few can share across this decrepit world."
HUN_Fehers_Pessimism:0 "The Pessimistic Marshall"
HUN_Fehers_Pessimism_desc:0 "Janos Feher has become the most feared man of Hungary. As the head of the new Hungarian army and the owner of a large farm outside of Budapest, Feher has been the main opponent of the unified parliament of Hungary. The brash optimism of the parliament contrasts with Feher’s realistic pessimism, worn down by his old age and experience, having known the luxury of the old world before the disaster. Feher has become a dangerous asset of the Hungarian Republic, as both a man with nothing to lose and something to prove."
