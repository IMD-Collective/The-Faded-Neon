POLITICS_georgios_karampoulis_DESC:0 "Georgios Karampoulis is a man of few words, and even less patience. \n\nLittle is publicly known about his life before the coup of the Colonel's Regime, and he prefers to keep it that way. To describe his rule as one of an Iron Fist would be to underestimate him. His long lived experience as a lowly captain under half a dozen governments has taught him that only one thing matters in politics, boldness. A lack of which he saw first hand under the previous regime's incompetence in the handling of the virus and the loss of sacred Greek land to the Huns on the other side of the Aegean. \n\nHaving decided to take matters into his own hands, he assembled a tight and loyal clique of young officers around him, radicalized beyond the petty reactionarism of the then ruling triumvirate. The turmoil following the loss of Thrace to the Turkish state was his opportunity to clean the old rotten house that was Greek politics."
