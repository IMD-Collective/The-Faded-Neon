FRA_leader_of_the_partnership_for_liberty:0 "Leader of the Partnership for Liberty"
FRA_leader_of_the_partnership_for_liberty_desc:0 "Following the fall of the United States in the wake of the plague crisis, the Partnership for Liberty was founded by the United Kingdom and France on the remnants of NATO in order to maintain an anti-Soviet sphere in Europe. The break-up of the United Kingdom made France the de facto leader of the organization, being the largest power to be part of it.\n\nThe main purpose of the organization is military coordination between the different member countries in order to protect each other from common threats, especially from the Cominform."

FRA_imprudent_capitalists_and_blind_gaullists:0 "Imprudent Capitalists and Blind Gaullists"
FRA_imprudent_capitalists_and_blind_gaullists_desc:0 "The NMR was formed at the initiative of the 1980 municipal elections in order to propose a united right in the face of the liberal government of Augustin Debreton, affected by multiple financial scandals and ridiculed by the failed intervention in Corsica. Two years later, Silvain LeMahieu was chosen at the end of a very tight primary to be candidate for the 1982 presidential election, that he won with 61% of the votes in the second round, which looked promising for the future of the French right.\n\nHowever, the movement remained divided on the question of extending the Partnership for Liberty to the economic level, LeMahieu being effectively a proponent of increased free trade between the different members of the organization, taking particular inspiration from the defunct ECSC. Many in the party felt that this was a departure from the ideas on which the NMR was founded, namely those of Gaullism, which were far less economically liberal than those of the current government.\n\nThe reparliamentarization of the regime following the proclamation of the sixth republic has restored the important place of the different chambers to the detriment of the president. As a result, a too abrupt departure from the party's ideas could well lead to a procedure of impeachment, which some of the party's most influential cadres might not hesitate to initiate if LeMahieu's presidency became too dangerous..."
